								<p>Automate shutdown.</p>
							</header>

							<p>
								It is possible to make system calls in python. So if you open up your command prompt, (Windows Key + R,
								type in cmd, press enter), you will be able to enter in commands to your computer. Command prompts are
								also called shells, because turtles are safe inside their shells and shells are super secure. Just kidding.
								Like if you type "dir," you will get a list of all the files in your current directory (a directory is a folder).
							<br>
							<br>
								What is great is that there is a python module (actually there's four modules) that lets you
								execute these commands in a python script. For this, let's use the <strong>Subprocess module</strong>.
							<br>
							<br><pre class="code-snippit">import subprocess<br>subprocess.call('dir')</pre>

								<br>
							    Sweet! You have a boring program that lists everything in the current folder! What is cool is that this works with
								other commands. Lots more commands. It's statistically likely at least one is a command you care about. Lets check
								out restart/shutdown.
							<br>
							<br>
								If you type "shutdown" in the commandline, your computer will turn off. If you type "shutdown /r" the computer
								will restart. "shutdown -l" will logoff your computer. If you are curious, "shutdown" is considered the command
								which calls the shutdown program (shutdown.exe can be found in your System32 file)
								and "-l" and "-r" are called arguments or parameters, which are values passed to the shutdown program. If no
								arguments are specified, the default action is to turn off the computer. So write this script:
							<br>
							<br>
							<pre class="code-snippit">import subprocess
subprocess.call('shutdown')
# subprocess.call(['shutdown', '-r'])
# subprocess.call(['shutdown', '-l'])</pre>
							<br>
								BTW: Anything followed by a # is ignored by the computer. If you want the script to restart your computer
								instead of shutting down the computer, put a # in front of the first subprocess call and remove the # from the
								line with '-r'.

							<br>
							<br>
								Yay! Now we have a script that can turn of the computer. Save it in a .pyw file and double click to run! But there
								are ways to make the script... better. Python has another module (it actually has a lot of modules) called <strong>
								ctype.</strong> This module lets you use built in Windows Libraries- specifically the Dynamic Link Libraries (dll).
								Essentially this means you can use system code in your script. One thing you can do with this is create notifications
								that look like the classic windows notifications. See below:
							<br>
							<br>
							<pre class="code-snippit">import ctypes  # An included library with Python install.
ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxA(None, "Your text", "Your title", 0)</pre>
							<br>
								So the first line imports the module, adn the second line makes the magic. There are four parameters here:
								the first specifies the parent, or the window that "owns" this window. You don't have to have a parent window,
								and we really don't care about assigning one, so we just write "None" which is Python's null object.
								The second parameter is the text that goes in the box. For example, type "Press any key to delete the system."
								The third parameter is teh title that goes in the bar. I recommend writing "System Message"
								The fourth parameter specifies what buttons are at the bottom of the box. Like if you put a zero there, the only
								button available is the "Ok" button. If want to know what all the options are, go to
								http://www.tutorialspoint.com/vbscript/vbscript_dialog_boxes.htm
							<br>
							<br>
							Almost done! If you put it together, you can get a script like this:
							<br>
							<br>
							<pre class="code-snippit">import subprocess
import ctypes  # An included library with Python install.
ctypes.windll.user32.MessageBoxA(None, "System Message", "Press any key to delete system.", 0)
subprocess.call('shutdown')</pre>
							<br>
							Now, if this script is run, a message box will pop up and your computer will turn off. Handy!
